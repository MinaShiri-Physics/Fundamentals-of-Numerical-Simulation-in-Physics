# 📊 Fundamentals-of-Numerical-Simulation

This repository contains my projects from "Fundamentals of Numerical Simulation in Physics" course, showcasing numerical methods for physical problems.

## 📂 Projects

🔵 [**Final Project: Transformations of Functions and Signals**](https://github.com/MinaShiri-Physics/Fundamentals-of-Numerical-Simulation-in-Physics/tree/main/Final%20Project)
  - Explores Fourier Transformation, Fourier Series, Orthogonal Polynomials (Legendre, Chebyshev), Laplace Transformation, Hilbert Transformation, Wavelet Transformation, and more.
  - Solves problems like Fourier Spectrum of Signals, Doppler Effect analysis, Laplace and Wavelet Transformations.

🔵 [**Ising Model Simulation**](https://github.com/MinaShiri-Physics/Fundamentals-of-Numerical-Simulation-in-Physics/tree/main/Ising%20Model%20Simulation)
  - Simulates the Ising model for phase transitions and magnetism using statistical methods.

🔵 [**Laplace Equation Numerical Solver**](https://github.com/MinaShiri-Physics/Fundamentals-of-Numerical-Simulation-in-Physics/tree/main/Laplace%20Equation%20Numerical%20Solver)
  - Solves Laplace's equation (∇²V = 0) in a 2D domain with mixed boundary conditions (e.g., V=0, V=1).
  - Uses finite difference method and separation of variables; analyzes mesh size and grid points' effect on convergence.

🔵 [**Radioactive Decay Behavior**](https://github.com/MinaShiri-Physics/Fundamentals-of-Numerical-Simulation-in-Physics/tree/main/Radioactive%20Decay%20Behavior)
  - Models mutual decay of nuclei A and B.
  - Confirms steady state NA = NB = 50 as t→∞, with stability condition Δt ≤ 1.
